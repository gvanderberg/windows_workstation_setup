# Windows Developer Workstation Setup

I created this script, using powershell and chocolatey, to streamline my developer workstation setup and be up and running with the least amount of effort in the least amount of time.

A single line executed from powershell and all your favourite tools are there and ready to be used.

```
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvanderberg/windows_workstation_setup/master/Setup-Workstation.ps1'))
```
